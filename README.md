## Installation

Thank you for purchasing **Custom Fields**! This guide provides step-by-step instructions on installing and configuring
the plugin.

### Requirements

- **PHP**: 8.0 or higher
- **Laravel**: 9.x or higher
- **Filament**: 3.x

### Activating your license on AnyStack

Custom Fields uses AnyStack to handle payment, licensing, and distribution.

During the purchasing process, AnyStack will provide you with a license key. You will also be asked by AnyStack to
activate your license by providing a domain. This is usually the domain of where your final project will live. Youâ€™ll
use this same domain to install locally and in production. Once you have provide a domain, your license key will be
activated and you can proceed with installing with composer below.

Tip: If you missed this step, or if you need to add additional domains for other projects, you can access the activation
page by going to Transactions in your AnyStack account and then clicking View details on the Custom Fields product.

Tip: You will need both your license key and your domain to authenticate when you install the package with composer.

### Installing with Composer

To install Custom Fields you'll need to add the package to your composer.json file:

```json
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "composer",
            "url": "https://filament-filter-sets.composer.sh"
        }
    ]
}
```

Once the repository has been added to your composer.json file, you can install Custom Fields like any other composer
package using the composer require command:

```bash
composer require relaticle/custom-fields
```

Next, you will be prompted to provide your username and password.

```bash
Loading composer repositories with package information
Authentication required (custom-fields.composer.sh):
Username: [licensee-email]
Password: [license-key]
```

Your username will be your email address and the password will is your license key, followed by a colon (:), followed by the domain you are activating. For example, let's say we have the following email and license activation:

- Contact email: myname@example.com
- License key: 9f3a2e1d-5b7c-4f86-a9d0-3e1c2b4a5f8e
- Activation fingerprint: my_domain.com

- You will need to enter the above information as follows when prompted for your credentials:

```bash
Loading composer repositories with package information
Authentication required (custom-fields.composer.sh):
Username: myname@example.com
Password: 9f3a2e1d-5b7c-4f86-a9d0-3e1c2b4a5f8e:my_domain.com
```

The license key and fingerprint should be separated by a colon (:).

> Tip: If you get a 402 error, most likely you forgot to add the colon and fingerprint.

## Setting up Custom Fields

This section will guide you through setting up and using the Custom Fields plugin in your Filament admin panel.

### Step 1: Publish and Run Migrations

Publish the migration files:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="custom-fields-migrations"
```

Run the migrations:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### Step 2: Publish the Configuration File (Optional)

If you wish to customize the configuration, publish the config file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="custom-fields-config"
```

This will create a `custom-fields.php` file in your `config` directory.

### Step 3: Integrating Custom Fields Plugin

In order to use Custom Fields, you need to register the plugin with your Filament panel. This is done in
your `PanelProvider` or wherever you are configuring your Filament panel.

```php
use Relaticle\CustomFields\CustomFieldsPlugin;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ... other panel configurations
        ->plugins([
            CustomFieldsPlugin::make(),
        ]);
}
```

### Step 4: Adding Custom Fields to Forms

To include custom fields in your resource forms, you'll use the `CustomFieldsComponent`. This component dynamically adds
all the custom fields associated with the resource.

In your resource class (e.g., `CompanyResource`), modify the `form()` method:

```php
use Relaticle\CustomFields\Filament\Forms\Components\CustomFieldsComponent;
use Filament\Forms;
use Filament\Resources\Form;

class CompanyResource extends Resource
{
    public static function form(Form $form): Form
    {
        return $form
            ->schema([
                // Your existing form fields
                Forms\Components\TextInput::make('name')
                    ->required(),
                Forms\Components\TextInput::make('email')
                    ->email(),

                // Add the CustomFieldsComponent
                CustomFieldsComponent::make()
                    ->columns(1), // You can adjust the number of columns
            ]);
    }

    // ...
}
```

### Step 5: Displaying Custom Fields in Table Views

To display custom fields in your table views, you need to use the `InteractsWithCustomFields` trait in your
resource's `ListRecords` page.

In your `ListCompanies` class, add the trait:

```php
use Relaticle\CustomFields\Filament\Tables\Concerns\InteractsWithCustomFields;
use Filament\Resources\Pages\ListRecords;

class ListCompanies extends ListRecords
{
    use InteractsWithCustomFields;

    // ...
}
```

This trait automatically includes all custom fields in the table view for the resource.

### Step 6: Setting Up the Model

Your model needs to implement the `HasCustomFields` interface and use the `UsesCustomFields` trait to work with custom
fields.

In your `Company` model, add the following:

```php
use Relaticle\CustomFields\Models\Contracts\HasCustomFields;
use Relaticle\CustomFields\Models\Concerns\UsesCustomFields;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Company extends Model implements HasCustomFields
{
    use UsesCustomFields;

    // ... your existing model code
}
```

By following these steps, your model will be fully equipped to handle custom fields, and you will have successfully set
up custom fields in your Filament panel, enabling dynamic and flexible data management.

```php
return [

    | This section controls which Filament resources are allowed or disallowed
    | to have custom fields. You can specify allowed resources, disallowed
    | resources, or leave them empty to use default behavior.
    |
    */
    'allowed_entity_resources' => [
        // App\Filament\Resources\UserResource::class,
    ],

    'disallowed_entity_resources' => [
        //
    ],

    /*

        'table' => [
            'columns_toggleable' => [
                'enabled' => true,
                'hidden_by_default' => true,
            ],
        ],
    ],

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Tenant Awareness Configuration
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | When enabled, this feature implements multi-tenancy using the specified
    | tenant foreign key. Enable this before running migrations to automatically
    | register the tenant foreign key.
    |
    */
    'tenant_aware' => false,

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Database Table Names
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | You can specify custom table names for the package's database tables here.
    | These tables will be used to store custom fields, their values, and options.
    |
    */
    'table_names' => [
        'custom_fields' => 'custom_fields',
        'custom_field_values' => 'custom_field_values',
        'custom_field_options' => 'custom_field_options',
    ],

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Column Names
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Here you can customize the names of specific columns used by the package.
    | For example, you can change the name of the tenant foreign key if needed.
    |
    */
    'column_names' => [
        'tenant_foreign_key' => 'tenant_id',
    ],
];
```
