# FlexFields Code Quality Optimization and Architectural Refinement PRD

## Overview
This project aims to conduct a comprehensive architectural review and refactoring of the FlexFields custom field system to eliminate code duplication, implement robust type safety through PHP 8.2+ features, and establish maintainable code patterns for long-term scalability. The focus is on creating a world-class, type-safe, and highly maintainable codebase that serves as a benchmark for Laravel/Filament package development.

## Logical Dependency Chain

### Foundation Layer (Phase 1)
- **Code Audit** → **Type System Design** → **Architecture Planning** → **Performance Baseline**
- All subsequent work depends on understanding current state and establishing clear improvement targets

### Type Safety Layer (Phase 2)  
- **ENUM Implementation** → **DTO Creation** → **Validation Types** → **Migration Tools**
- Type system must be established before code consolidation can begin effectively

### Consolidation Layer (Phase 3)
- **Abstract Classes** → **Trait Implementation** → **Template Unification** → **Service Optimization**
- Requires completed type system to ensure all abstractions are properly typed

### Optimization Layer (Phase 4)
- **Caching Strategy** → **Performance Optimization** → **Error Handling** → **Documentation**
- Final optimizations and polish that depend on consolidated, type-safe codebase
