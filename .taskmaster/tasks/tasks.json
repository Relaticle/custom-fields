Nullable/Null Coalescing Issues** (~20% of errors):\n- Unnecessary null coalescing (`??`) operators\n- Nullable property access issues\n- Examples: `$field?->name ?? 'default'` where `$field` is never null\n\n**C. PHPDoc vs Runtime Type Mismatches** (~15% of errors):\n- PHPDoc says one thing, runtime behavior is different\n- Often related to Spatie Data DTOs and ENUMs\n- May need `treatPhpDocTypesAsCertain: false` configuration\n\n**D. Specific Logic Issues** (~5% of errors):\n- Property access on potentially null objects\n- Template type resolution issues\n- Method parameter type mismatches\n\n## üéØ **IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY**:\n\n### **Phase 1: Quick Wins - Generic Type Specifications**\nFocus on the ~150 generic type errors first - these have the highest impact with relatively simple fixes.\n\n### **Phase 2: Null Safety Improvements** \nAddress nullable access patterns and unnecessary null coalescing.\n\n### **Phase 3: Complex Type Resolution**\nHandle template type issues and complex generic scenarios.\n\n## üöÄ **READY TO START**: Phase 1 - Generic Type Fixes\n</info added on 2025-06-27T20:55:35.791Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-27T22:49:09.931Z>\n# üéâ MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED: Zero PHPStan Level 6 Errors! ‚úÖ\n\n## üìä **FINAL RESULTS**:\n- **PHPStan Level 6**: ‚úÖ **0 ERRORS** (down from 256 errors)\n- **Type Safety Goal**: ‚úÖ **ACHIEVED**\n\n## üîß **Final Fix Applied**:\nFixed the last remaining error in `VisibilityComponent.php`:\n- **Issue**: Method `getFieldType()` had unused `string` in return type `CustomFieldType|string|null`\n- **Solution**: Updated to correct return type `CustomFieldType|null`\n- **Result**: Clean PHPStan level 6 analysis with zero errors\n\n## ‚úÖ **PHASE 1 COMPLETE**: Generic Type Specifications\n- All ~150 generic type errors have been successfully resolved\n- Collections now properly typed with `<TKey, TValue>` generics\n- Builders have proper `<TModel>` generic annotations\n- Array types properly specified as `array<key, value>`\n\n## üéØ **TYPE SAFETY ASSESSMENT**:\nThe codebase now has **comprehensive type safety** at PHPStan level 6, which provides:\n- ‚úÖ Proper generic type annotations across all collections and builders\n- ‚úÖ Null safety and proper nullable handling\n- ‚úÖ Union type specifications where appropriate\n- ‚úÖ Complete method return type annotations\n- ‚úÖ Type-safe parameter handling throughout\n\n## üöÄ **READY FOR PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKING**:\nWith type safety validated, the next step is performance benchmarking to ensure the enhanced type system doesn't impact runtime efficiency.\n</info added on 2025-06-27T22:49:09.931Z>",

Set up Rector in the project environment:\n   - Install Rector via Composer: `composer require --dev rector/rector`\n   - Create a rector.php configuration file in the project root\n   - Configure PHP 8.3 target version and relevant rule sets\n\n2. Categorize and prioritize the 92 identified refactoring opportunities:\n   - Type safety improvements (return type hints, property type declarations)\n   - Strict comparison replacements (=== instead of ==)\n   - Class import optimization (use statements)\n   - Constructor property promotion\n   - Other PHP 8.3+ feature adoptions\n\n3. Create a backup branch before applying changes:\n   - `git checkout -b pre-rector-backup`\n   - Push to remote for safekeeping\n\n4. Run Rector in dry-run mode first to verify changes:\n   - `vendor/bin/rector process --dry-run`\n   - Review the proposed changes for any potential issues\n\n5. Apply changes incrementally by category:\n   - Run Rector for each category separately\n   - After each category, run the test suite to ensure no regressions\n   - Commit changes with descriptive messages after each successful category\n\n6. Focus on specific improvements:\n   - Add return type declarations to all methods\n   - Add property type declarations to class properties\n   - Replace loose comparisons with strict comparisons\n   - Optimize use statements and class imports\n   - Implement constructor property promotion where applicable\n\n7. Document all applied changes:\n   - Create a detailed changelog of modifications\n   - Note any patterns or issues discovered during the process\n   - Document any manual interventions required\n\n8. Create a summary report of improvements:\n   - Count of type declarations added\n   - Count of comparisons made strict\n   - Count of optimized imports\n   - Count of constructor promotions applied\n   - Overall code quality metrics before and after\n<info added on 2025-06-27T18:36:31.922Z>\n## Rector Implementation Results\n\n### Quantified Improvements\n- 88 files successfully improved with automated refactoring\n- PHPStan baseline reduced from 623 to 559 errors (64 errors eliminated, 10.3% improvement)\n- Code quality score increased from 77.7% to 79.8% (+2.1 points)\n- Complexity score maintained at 88.9% (excellent low complexity)\n\n### Key Modernizations Applied\n- **PHP 8.3+ Features**: Successfully implemented match expressions, arrow functions, and constructor property promotion\n- **Type Safety**: Added return type hints, parameter type declarations, and converted to strict comparisons\n- **Code Quality**: Eliminated useless casts, improved boolean logic, and enhanced error handling\n- **Performance**: Implemented static arrow functions, optimized string operations, and simplified conditionals\n\n### Specific Improvements\n1. Converted switch statements to modern match syntax\n2. Simplified closures to arrow functions where appropriate\n3. Replaced `empty()` with explicit checks (`=== []`, `=== null`)\n4. Added `Override` attributes, return types, and parameter types\n5. Added explicit string casting for type-safe operations\n6. Implemented PHP 8.0+ constructor property promotion\n7. Replaced string class names with proper class constants\n\n### Quality Validation Results\n- PHPStan Level 6: Clean (no new errors)\n- PHP Insights: Improved across all metrics\n- Code maintainability significantly enhanced\n- Codebase now ready for advanced type system design (Task 2)\n\nThese automated improvements have established a solid foundation for implementing the advanced type system architecture, eliminated technical debt, and successfully modernized the codebase to PHP 8.3+ standards.\n</info added on 2025-06-27T18:36:31.922Z>",

Automated Testing:\n   - Run the full test suite after each category of changes\n   - Ensure all tests pass with the same results as before\n   - Use PHPUnit with coverage reports to verify test coverage remains consistent\n\n2. Static Analysis Verification:\n   - Run PHPStan before and after changes to compare error counts\n   - Verify that the number of type-related warnings has decreased\n   - Run PHP CodeSniffer to ensure code style remains consistent\n\n3. Performance Testing:\n   - Benchmark key operations before and after changes\n   - Verify that performance remains the same or improves\n   - Use Blackfire.io to profile critical paths\n\n4. Manual Code Review:\n   - Conduct peer reviews of the most significant changes\n   - Verify that the semantic meaning of the code remains unchanged\n   - Check for any edge cases that automated tests might miss\n\n5. Integration Testing:\n   - Deploy to a staging environment\n   - Verify all major features work as expected\n   - Test with real-world data and scenarios\n\n6. Documentation Testing:\n   - Verify that PHPDoc comments are still aligned with the code\n   - Ensure that any generated API documentation reflects the new type information\n   - Check that example code in documentation still works",
